**MedSearch** is a map application that helps users in Ghana find nearby pharmacies stocking a given medicine. It leverages a Postgres/PostGIS database, a Node.js/Express backend, and a React frontend with Google Maps integration. Users can type a medicine name, see autocomplete suggestions, adjust search radius, and view pharmacy locations on a map, complete with direction routes.
